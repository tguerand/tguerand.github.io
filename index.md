## Welcome to my website

I am Tristan Guérand, a PhD Candidate at Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Thomas Peyrin](https://thomaspeyrin.github.io/web/). I study cryptography and machine learning.

I am also graduated from Université Paris-Saclay - CentraleSupélec with a MEng in Applied Mathematics for Data Science in 2021.

I also host a [podcast](https://2potesquicastent.com/) with my friend [Lancelot Brun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lancelotbrun/) in french.
