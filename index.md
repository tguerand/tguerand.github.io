## About me

I am Tristan Guérand, a Quantitative Researcher at [Qube Research and Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/) in Singapore, working on High Frequency Signals since August 2025. Previously, I was a PhD Candidate at Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Thomas Peyrin](https://thomaspeyrin.github.io/web/), where I studied cryptography and machine learning. My main interests include Explainable AI (XAI), Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) and Privacy in Machine Learning.

I graduated from Université Paris-Saclay - CentraleSupélec with a MEng in Applied Mathematics for Data Science in 2021.

I also hosted a [podcast](https://2potesquicastent.com/) with my friend [Lancelot Brun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lancelotbrun/) in french.
