## Work Experience

### [Nanyang Technological University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University), 2022 Current PhD Student
Under the supervision of [Thomas Peyrin](https://thomaspeyrin.github.io/web/).
PhD Thesis on cryptography and machine learning

### [2 Potes Qui Castent](https://2potesquicastent.com/), 2021 Cofounder and host
* Bimensual podcast with [Lancelot Brun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lancelotbrun/) on technology in french 
* 1500+ streaming, 100+ followers

### [Stellantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis) - 2018 2021 Data Scientist, traineeship
* Implemented several algorithms in Python to improve quality controls in
Stellantis factories in a team of 5 engineers
* Studied feasibility for different visual controls, backtested promising
algorithms and deployed them in more than 5 factories with Azure with an
objective of 70 use cases
    * Outside Vehicle Conformity Control Checked the vehicle details (
wheel rims, with deep learning with a quality control improvement
from 80 to 95 It resulted in a gain of one to three operator per
shift for each factory Deployed labeling tool on Azure Webapp with
Docker to allow operators to correct false positives detections In
charge of two production line at the beginning of the deployment
    * Anomaly Segmentation on head gasket Improved existing automatic
control by shifting the specialized algorithm to a general one with
neural networks Gained one operator per shift

### [BNP Paribas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas) - 2020 2021 MEng research Project
* Developed a recommendation system with Graph Neural Networks for their
financial products.
* Lessened recommendations similarity by 20% on benchmark dataset.
