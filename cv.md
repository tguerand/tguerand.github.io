## Work Experience

### [Qube Research and Technologies / QRT](https://www.qube-rt.com/)
<div class="cv-date-location">May 2024 – October 2024 | Singapore</div>
<div class="cv-position">Quantitative Researcher Intern</div>

- Improved latency of Machine Learning based alphas in a low latency team
- Worked with advanced trading infrastructure and research tools

### [Nanyang Technological University / NTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University)
<div class="cv-date-location">2022 – Present | Singapore</div>
<div class="cv-position">PhD Student</div>

Under the supervision of [Thomas Peyrin](https://thomaspeyrin.github.io/web/).

- PhD Thesis on cryptography and machine learning
- Teacher Assistant for the following courses:
  - Introduction to Python ([PS0001](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider123/obtl/mas/updated-obtl/ps0001-spms-mas-outcomes-based-teaching-and-learning-document-(obtl)-29th-may-2023.pdf?sfvrsn=2286bd85_3))
  - Statistics ([PS0002](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider123/obtl/mas/updated-obtl/ps0002-spms-mas-outcomes-based-teaching-and-learning-document-(obtl)-20th-feb-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=8edf78ae_3))
  - Algorithms for the real world ([MH3400](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider123/obtl/mas/updated-obtl/mh3400-spms-mas-outcomes-based-teaching-and-learning-document-(obtl)-19th-nov-2021.pdf?sfvrsn=9aae80c1_3))

### [2 Potes Qui Castent](https://2potesquicastent.com/)
<div class="cv-date-location">2021 – 2022</div>
<div class="cv-position">Cofounder and Host</div>

- Bimonthly podcast with [Lancelot Brun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lancelotbrun/) on technology in French
- 1500+ streams, 100+ followers

### [Stellantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis)
<div class="cv-date-location">2018 – 2021 | Paris Area, France</div>
<div class="cv-position">Data Scientist, Traineeship</div>

- Implemented several algorithms in Python to improve quality controls in Stellantis factories in a team of 5 engineers
- Studied feasibility for different visual controls, backtested promising algorithms and deployed them in more than 5 factories with Azure with an objective of 70 use cases
  - **Outside Vehicle Conformity Control**: Checked vehicle details (wheel rims) with deep learning, improving quality control from 80% to 95%. Resulted in a gain of one to three operators per shift for each factory. Deployed labeling tool on Azure Webapp with Docker to allow operators to correct false positive detections. In charge of two production lines at the beginning of the deployment
  - **Anomaly Segmentation on head gasket**: Improved existing automatic control by shifting the specialized algorithm to a general one with neural networks. Gained one operator per shift

### [BNP Paribas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas)
<div class="cv-date-location">2020 – 2021</div>
<div class="cv-position">MEng Research Project</div>

- Developed a recommendation system with Graph Neural Networks for their financial products
- Reduced recommendations similarity by 20% on benchmark dataset
