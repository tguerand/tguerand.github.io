I currently work on cryptography and machine learning.

I am mainly interested in efficient machine learning, more precisely on quantization / quantized neural networks and their applications, like for Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) with Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), or also using specific hardware.
