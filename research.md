## Overview

I currently work on cryptography and machine learning, with a focus on efficient and privacy-preserving machine learning systems.

## Main Research Interests

### Efficient Machine Learning

I am mainly interested in efficient machine learning, more precisely on quantization and quantized neural networks and their applications. This includes:

- **Quantization techniques**: Developing methods to reduce the precision of neural network weights and activations while maintaining performance
- **Hardware-specific optimizations**: Adapting neural network architectures for efficient deployment on specialized hardware

### Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)

A significant part of my research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly:

- **Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: Designing neural network architectures that are compatible with FHE schemes, enabling computation on encrypted data
- **Privacy in Machine Learning**: Exploring methods to train and deploy machine learning models while protecting sensitive data

### Explainable AI (XAI)

I am also interested in making machine learning models more interpretable and explainable:

- **Interpretable neural network architectures**: Developing models that are both accurate and interpretable
- **Rule-based models**: Creating neural network-based rule models that provide clear decision-making processes

## Current Work

My PhD research, under the supervision of [Thomas Peyrin](https://thomaspeyrin.github.io/web/), focuses on bridging the gap between cryptography and machine learning, with particular emphasis on:

- Designing FHE-friendly neural network architectures
- Developing scalable and verifiable neural networks
- Creating interpretable models for real-world applications
